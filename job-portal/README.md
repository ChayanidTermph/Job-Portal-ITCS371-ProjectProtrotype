# How to Run Our Website (FOR WINDOW)

1. Open MySQL Workbench, login with your `username` and `password`, then open these 2 files (`create_jobcenter_templete.sql` and `insert_data.sql`) from the "database" folder in the program.
2. After running the 2 sql files, you will have your local database.
3. Open terminal (or cmd) and change the directory to the `job-portal` folder.
4. Type ```node app.js``` on the terminal.
Expected result on the terminal:
   > Server running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
   Connected to MySQL database.
5. Open your brownser and access to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
6. Enjoy our website!
